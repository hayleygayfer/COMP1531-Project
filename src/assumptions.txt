AUTH.PY ASSUMPTIONS
Logging in is determined by whether or not the user's token is set as their email, if it is not set they are not logged in
if an email is not recognised the program should return a prompt to register / inform the user they are not registered
if an email is recognised but the password does not match the program should inform the user the entered password is incorrect
Logging out is done by adjusting the user's token to be empty
If the token is not recognised whilst logging out, the program should assume this means they are not registered, and inform the user
The user should be informed when they are successful if logging out, and if it is found the token does not exist, return that they are already logged out
The u_id is iterative, starting at user 1, etc
