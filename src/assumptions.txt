- If an email is recognised but the password does not match the program should inform the user the entered password is incorrect
- Logging out is done by adjusting the user's token to be empty
- If the token is not recognised whilst logging out, the program should assume this means they are not registered, and inform the user
- The user should be informed when they are successful if logging out, and if it is found the token does not exist, return that they are already logged out
- The u_id is iterative, starting at user 1, etc
